Living on campus is a one and done experience as a freshman. You do it because TTU forces you, not because you want to.  Why in the world would you want to deal with the University rules and parking that would come with living on campus. Especially parking. The less exposure to university parking services, the more pleasurable ones time will be at TTU. Plus, the off campus options are only growing. I think this would be a horrible waste of resources. I think you would be hard pressed to operate it at a viable capacity.    In regards to the question asked about meal plans, why would I want to pay a lot of upfront money for overly crappy below average cafeteria food? Even if there is a chain offering, think Einsteins and Chick-fil-a, you can only eat so much of it. Meal plans are just another scam operated by TTU to try to trick people into thinking they are getting a good deal, when in reality they are not. A meal plan locks up a lump sum of cash, forcing it to ALL be spent with hospitality services. It makes much more sense to keep the cash allowing you far greater choices in your dining options. If one is so inclined to receive the discounts offered by transferring money into the system, it can be accomplished in small amounts. Because of this, I find it comical to suggest than one could benefit in anyway from purchasing a meal plan.    Overall, the mere idea of a graduate dorm is a misguided idea. There are far better uses of campus land and TTU resources than this. For one,you could upgrade the old residence halls and bring them out of the 1960's and into the 21st century. Think Chitwood-Weymouth and Coleman. Living in Weymouth as a freshman was little more than living in a high school football locker-room."

I am not sure how this would work, but a variety of number of bedrooms in each living area would be nice.  And it would need to be separate from undergraduates, since many teach undergraduate classes it would be difficult to have undergraduate students viewing you as in charge of the class if you lived down the hall from them."

To everyone else take into account cost while a more expensive location for graduate students who are just here for a summer session might be feasible most graduate students I know do not live in the ""fancy apartments"" like Grove, Dominion etc. low cost is key.
